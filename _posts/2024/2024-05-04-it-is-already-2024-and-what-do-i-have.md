Finally I've built yet another github.io personal website.

In recent years, I entered the world of professional application development. This transition, combined with my previous experience in OPS or middleware-level development, has opened a completely new world for me. So far in my career, I've had the special opportunity to experience the entire lifecycle of products—from gauging market potential to defining requirements, from hardware considerations through middleware and software, to installation and maintenance.

This journey drives me to reflect on several questions: Where am I? What do I have? It's already 2024, and I assume my life is halfway over. How do I want to play in the second half? Am I satisfied with the first half? Can I leave more value in this world?

I know, I am talking big. But returning to concrete actions, I realize it's late if I don't start writing and publishing now. I am a unique copy of myself; my experiences are uniquely mine as well. I have my observations and ideas—they might be wrong, but so what? If I don't share them, I can't even get the feedback necessary to understand their pitfalls. "Be bold and try hard"—this is the lesson my lost time and past experiences have taught me. I will never have more time again; I need to take action, do the things I want to do, and not have regrets when I am older.

So yes, this is the purpose of this website. It has had many past versions that I've given away. I always stepped back, scared to expose my ignorance and unrefined thoughts. But now, I will just keep it as it is and put my fingers to the keyboard to type and write.
